This project is an ongoing, expanding, and extensible library designed to provide functionality for multiple metaheuristic algorithms (such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing), written in C# with .NET, to provide a wide range of functionality to users and provide an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use basis for using these exciting (and sometimes complex-sounding) algorithms to developers. No guarantee is made that the algorithms contained herein are written as optimally as possible, or that they are 100% error free - like any software, bugs and oversights will occur.
